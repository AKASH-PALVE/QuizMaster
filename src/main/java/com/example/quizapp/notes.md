Notes/Observations : 
    - the hot reload not working
    - lombok is not working !
    - Arraylist(class) is implementation of interface List

Doubts :
http://localhost:8080/question/category/kotlin 
does not give error but empty list
why not just use the 1 DAO object everywhere , why new for each service ? 
what happening in the dao , as the object of interface is not possible so how the autowire is working ?


what is the diff between @Pathvariable and @RequestPararm ? 
How the data conversion is happening between data sent and received like json and also how the request url is sent (format), how the body is sent , Jsson ? ., Just get the clarity of all the things happenign about the data conversion !  
when to use which type of service ? 
learn about equals ! 

Progress : 

get quiz not working !
